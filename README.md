# 📽️ Movie Website 

🌟 This website is inspired from Netflix, I have developed the dashboard using plain HTML & CSS.

🌟 I have learned to Use HTML & CSS to develop clean UI

🌟 One of my Initial Works but worth looking back...


I can't deploy this as the UI is the same as of Netflix (Another thing I have learnt 😅)

But, here are the Photos..

But,These days creating UI Mockups is just a 2 Minutes work...
Nonethless, It's always better to know what you have did.
